GiveUp,Abandonment,[Abandonment] An Agent leaves behind a Theme effectively rendering it no longer within their control or of the normal security as one's property.   'Carolyn abandoned her car and jumped on a red double decker bus.'  'Perhaps he left the key in the ignition'  'Abandonment of a child is considered to be a serious crime in many jurisdictions.'  There are also metaphorically used examples:  'She left her old ways behind .',"An event where an Agent relinquishes control or responsibility over a Theme, leaving it without protection, possession, or supervision.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Achieve,Accomplishment,"[Accomplishment] After a period in which the Agent has been working on a Goal, the Agent manages to attain it.  The Goal may be a desired state, or be conceptualized as an event. '' 'Jeremey obediently accomplished this task.'  'In response, the Prime Minister has simply cited his free-market accomplishments. '  ",An event where an Agent successfully achieves a Goal after a period of effort or work toward it.,anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
GetReady,Activity ready state,"[Activity_ready_state] The Protagonist is in an initial state, before beginning to be involved in the Activity, but all pre-conditions for performance of the Activity have been satisfied.  In many cases, the Protagonist is an intentional agent, but there are other uses in which the agent is deprofiled, and the Protagonist is an entity which is essential to the Activity.   Alternatively, the Activity may be indicated by a Salient_entity which stands in for the Activity.  This Salient_entity may also be an intentional agent, but need not be.  'She 's not ready ! DNI.' 'He 's ready to talk , I think .' 'Is the UK government ready to do a u-turn on passport-ID cards ?' 'Check and see if Sal is ready for the bathtub .' 'The world is finally prepared for him !'",An event or condition where a Protagonist has completed all necessary preparations and is in a state of readiness to initiate a specific Activity.,anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Adducing,Adducing,"[Adducing] A Speaker mentions a Specified_entity filling a Role, thereby providing information which supports a point of the Speaker.  'He cites the chief original observations adduced by Darwin as evidence for his theory.'  'Mexico cited the drought, now in its eighth year, to avoid releasing Texas' full share of 110 billion gallons per year from the reservoirs. DNI'  'An objector will immediately point to the lack of stability of this  simple, some will say simple-minded, hierarchy. DNI'  'She expected a restaurant as their meeting place, but instead the lady named the hotel where she was staying.DNI'  'Where is the second-order neural pattern located? Damasio already pointed to the cingulate cortex in his 1994 book.'","An event where a Speaker presents or refers to an entity or example to support a claim, argument, or point.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Choosing,"Adopt selection, Choosing","[Adopt_selection] An Agent has an Attribute which can take different Values, and the Agent selects and then begins to use some Value for that Attribute.  The Attribute includes both physical (shape, color) and abstract (belief, practice) types.  For some LUs in this frame, it is common for only the Value to be expressed, with the Attribute implicit. (Often this implicit attribute can be given second-layer expression on the Value. Note that such second-layer annotation should be assumed in the first two examples below.)  'They scoff at their opponents and assume an air of superior knowledge' 'There are times when teachers should adopt a neutral stance in discussion of morally controversial issues.' 'A person does not have to make the statement ""I adopt this as my position"" to do so.' 
[Choosing] A Cognizer decides upon the Chosen (either an item or a course of action) out of a set of  Possibilities .  The Cognizer may have an Inherent_purpose or a Larger_purpose for the Chosen.  Often an Explanation, which serves as the basis of the choice, is given.  'The council picked you out of all the pilots available to head this mission.' 'No one would choose to live in such squalor.' 'If no judge was unanimously selected in the previous round, play rock-paper-scissors pairwise. CNI' ","An event where an Agent or Cognizer selects a particular option, value, or course of action from a set of available possibilities, typically involving intentional decision-making.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Agree or refuse to act,Agree or refuse to act,"[Agree_or_refuse_to_act] A Speaker either agrees to or refuses to engage in a Proposed_action, proposed by an Interlocutor. '' 'They agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today's paper.'  'The man's refusal to accept blood severely hampered his treatment after the car accident.' ",An  event where an individual responds to a proposed action by either consenting to or rejecting participation in that action.,anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Aiming,Aiming,"[Aiming] An Agent adjusts an Instrument to enable it to interact directly with a difficult-to-access Target_location.  Usually, there is a Targeted entity at the Target_location which is mentioned in its place.  'If you aim your weapons somewhere else , I 'll be more likely to talk .' 'The sortie targeted primarily resupply points , but these included several civilian areas . INI' 'A good marksman still should take aim for a moment before each shot . INI INI'",An event where an Agent intentionally directs or adjusts an Instrument toward a specific Target location to prepare for interaction or action.,anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Arranging,"Arranging, Making arrangements","[Arranging] An Agent puts a complex Theme into a particular Configuration, which can be a proper order, a correct or suitable sequence, or a spatial position.  'He arranged the elements in the pattern that we now call the periodic table.'  'Try to order them by importance. CNI ' 
[Making_arrangements] An Agent performs a series of unspecified tasks to plan for an Event to take place at a Scheduled_time and Place.  'I've arranged a breakfast meeting for you tomorrow morning with Mr. Huntsberger.'  'Kevin and Beth organized the graduate student conference this year.'",An event where an Agent organizes elements into a structured configuration or prepares for an Event by completing necessary planning tasks.,anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Arrest,"Arrest, Detaining, Imprisonment, Being incarcerated, Being in captivity","[Arrest] Authorities charge a Suspect, who is under suspicion of having committed a crime (the Charges), and take him/her into custody.'The police arrested Harry on charges of manslaughter.'
[Detaining] The Authorities hold a Suspect under suspicion of having committed a crime (Charges). The Holding_location and period of detention (Duration) may also be specified. 'The police held Mr. Smith in the slammer on charges of killing his lawyer.'
[Imprisonment] The Authorities put a Prisoner in Prison as punishment for an Offense.   'US Drug Researcher Imprisoned for FDA Fraud.' 'Men will be more likely to be put away for murder rather than manslaughter for killing their wives.' 'However, any treatments may be years in the future and in the meantime, criminals will continue to be imprisoned for public safety.'  'The government wrongfully imprisoned them in ?detention centers? (a nice term for concentration camps), tortured them mentally and physically' 
[Being_incarcerated] A Prisoner is punished for committing a Crime by being confined to a Prison for a specified period of time.  'Phil's serving time at Pelican Bay.'
[Being_in_captivity] A Theme is held in captivity by an Agent or Cause.  'Twenty soldiers were in captivity for over a month before they were released'  'I never release my prisoners.'  'She couldn't believe she was prisoner in her own home.'","An event where an Authority or Agent restrains a Suspect or Prisoner by taking them into custody, detaining them, or holding them confined as a consequence of suspicion, accusation, or conviction of wrongdoing.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Assistance,Assistance,[Assistance] A Helper benefits a Benefited_party by enabling the culmination of a Goal that the Benefited_party has.  A Focal_entity that is involved in reaching the Goal may stand in for it.  This Frame has unique Frame-to-Frame Relations: it inherits from and uses the Intentionally_act frame. This is atypical of FrameNet's frame relations.  'Will you help the Government find your brother?' 'Maybe Stephen should assist him with the last manuscript.' 'They helped me psychologically to overcome the physical loss I had suffered.' 'You have helped him tremendously by showing him  how to stand up for himself and by being his friend.' 'By bringing assistance to his troops wherever they were in trouble he aided them greatly.',"An event where a Helper intentionally supports or enables a Benefited Party in achieving their Goal or overcoming an obstacle, either directly or by providing necessary aid.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Preventing or letting,"Avoiding, Preventing, Prevent from having, Preventing or letting","[Avoiding] An Agent avoids an Undesirable_situation under certain Circumstances. That situation may be an activity (e.g. going to school), or an entity (perhaps) metonymic for such an activity or situation (e.g. the curb).  In this frame, the situation is undesirable from the Agent's point of view (e.g. evade), and contrasts with scenes in which the situation is specifically undesirable to someone else (e.g. forbear) or from the point of view of an external morality (e.g. abstain).  'Mike avoided his supervisor at all costs.'
[Preventing_or_letting] A Potential_hindrance or an Agent (via their actions) keeps an Event from taking place, or despite the possibility of prevent the Event, do not do so. Lexical units which indicate that the event is not prevented, e.g. allow.v, are marked with the semantic type ""Negative"".  Some lexical units, like avert and avoid indicate that the Potential_hindrance or Agent would have been affected if the Event occurred.   ' Rain prevented the ball game from taking place.'   ' He could have stopped the riot .'  ' The government narrowly averted a coup . ' 'She allowed more than a few mistakes to happen .' 'Technology has permitted firms to link together more closely.' 'Unlike DOS , Windows lets you get on with something else when sending a fax.' 'Liberalization allows easier entry into particular markets .' 'Mesh allows the water to circulate normally through the aquarium.'  ''  Unlike in the Thwarting frame, the Potential_hindrance or Agent does not directly prevent the actions of an individual, but rather affects the world in such a way that an Event cannot occur.","An agent or condition influences whether an undesirable event or situation occurs, either by actively preventing it or by allowing it to happen.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Bearing arms,Bearing arms,"[Bearing_arms] A Protagonist has (or does not have) a Weapon.  The Degree to which the Protagonist is armed may also be described.  The Protagonist is normally a human but may be a device that has subsidiary weapons.  'Apparently, the suspect is armed with a shotgun.' 'After she pulled the .45 from her sock drawer, she felt well enough armed to face anyone coming in.' 'The Tomahawk missile packs a lot of heat .'  'An individual with a right-to-carry license may continue to carry in a ""school zone"" in compliance with existing state and local laws. INI'","An event or state where a Protagonist possesses or is equipped with a Weapon, with the extent of their armament potentially being specified.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Becoming,Becoming,"[Becoming] An Entity ends up with some Final_quality--a new fact about the Entity. Alternatively, based on a cluster of changes of characteristics, the Entitynewly meets the conditions for being a member of a Final_category.  'The weather turned cold .' 'You can become a firefighter today !'  This frame should be compared with the Transition_to_state frame, which is more general in allowing arbitrary descriptions of a final situation:  'We ended up telling him to leave .'  There is no way to effectively paraphrase such a sentence in the Becoming frame.  ","An event where an Entity acquires a new quality, characteristic, or category membership, resulting in a change of its state or classification.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,atomic,non-agentive
Becoming a member,Becoming a member,[Becoming_a_member] A New_member becomes a member of a socially-constructed Group. 'Seven new members and the three countries joined the alliance five years ago.' 'Most new students enroll in a university without declaring a major.' 'It represents every man and woman who has enlisted in the armed forces to protect our families and serve the community.',An event where an individual or entity enters into membership within a socially-defined Group.,anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Know,Becoming aware,"[Becoming_aware] Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer adding some Phenomenon to their model of the world. They are similar to Coming-to-believe words, except the latter generally involve reasoning from Evidence.  '' The words in this frame take direct objects that denote entities in the world, and indicate awareness of those entities, without necessarily giving any information about the content of the Cognizer's belief or knowledge. These words also resemble perception words, since creatures often become aware of things by perceiving them.  'Later that night, they found the barely-alive victim inside the Red Hall estate flat.'  'Almost immediately, the police discovered the wrought-iron crypt gate swinging open.'  'In the bag on the tableI could vaguelydiscern two bottles of wine and several cartons of cakes and other goodies.'  'People passing through recognize it from afar, by the clouds of coal dust darkening the air.'   General Grammatical Observations: Passive forms of the verbs in this frame can occur with extraposed clauses expressing Phenomenon: 'That year it was discovered that consumers preferred the older model.' 'It is not always recognized how much work goes into a dinner party.'","A cognizer perceives or notices a phenomenon, thereby incorporating it into their understanding of the world, without necessarily reasoning from evidence.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,non-agentive
Being in operation,"Being in operation, Being operational","[Being_in_operation] A Device or machine is in (or out of) service. Note that being broken or functional is a separate issue from being turned on or off. This latter notion is what the present frame is concerned with. <br /> The Time when and the Place where the Device is in use may be specified, as may be the Purpose a backgrounded human User had in turning the Device on or off.    'The TV is on' 'The lights were off when I came by.'  
[Being_operational] An Object with an understood function is or is not in a state ready to perform that function.  'The remote is almost broken.'  'Hand me that broken watch so I can throw it away.'","An event or state where a Device or Object is functioning, turned on, or prepared to perform its intended role.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Control,"Being in control, Domination, Control, Self control","[Being_in_control] A Controlling_entity has control of a Dependent_entity, Dependent_situation, or Dependent_variable.   'She was in control of the empire within two days.'  This frame is distinct from Control in that the Controlling_entity is not fully asserted to be currently controlling the Dependent_entity, Dependent_situation, or Dependent_variable, but rather is attentive to it and capable of making the situation correspond to the desired state at any time.
[Domination] An Agent has a influential, controlling position in a Situation, and is the primary causal factor in the development of the Situation, leaving other Competitors unable to take controlling positions.  Two perspectives are taken on this frame, one where the Agent is viewed as controlling primarily the Situation, and another where the Agent is viewed as primarily influencing the other Competitors in the Situation.
[Control] A Controlling_entity, Controlling_situation, or Controlling_variable control a Dependent_entity, Dependent_situation, or Dependent_variable. The latter, dependent, element or some aspect of it is not just influenced, but determined by the controlling element.  'Can you control the robot?' 'Although you may not be able to control every situation, you can control your reaction.' 'Students do not have control over the temperature of the heating water.' 'Everyone knows that the price of oil controls the price of asphalt.'
[Self_control] An Agent actively (yet not always with success) attempts to keep themselves from participating in an Event. The Agent is usually pushed to the Event because of an internal urge. '' 'He couldn't help but peek.'","An event where an Agent or Controlling Entity exerts, attempts, or maintains influence over a Dependent Entity, Situation, Variable, or themselves, either by directing its state, limiting its change, or preventing undesired outcomes.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Breathing,Breathing,"[Breathing] An Agent causes Air to move in a direction, usually specifying either in or out of the body.  'Lee breathed the hot desert air.'","An event where an Agent moves air into or out of their body, typically as part of a natural physiological process.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Besieging,Besieging,"[Besieging] An Assailant, a group of armed forces, surrounds the Victim, a military location and the people within it, in an attempt to cut the Victim off from the outside, with the goal of either forcing their surrender or weakening them so that an invasion would be successful. A successful siege is often followed by the Assailant taking control of (the land held by) the Victim.  'Towards the end of the summer, a great English host besieged the Danish fort of Tempsford and took it, killing the last Danish king of East Anglia.'","An event where an Assailant surrounds and isolates a Victim, typically a fortified location, with the strategic goal of forcing surrender, weakening resistance, or preparing for invasion.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Carry goods,Carry goods,"[Carry_goods] A Distributor sells, lends, or otherwise distributes a class of Goods. In the prototypical case, the Distributor is a retailer who generally keeps some type of Goods on site for the purpose of selling it to a buyer. Extensions include lending Goods (e.g., libraries, movie rental outlets), organization-internal distribution (as in a hospital), or other non-commercial distribution centers. The Goods are constrained to be a type of item (e.g., canned goods, antique dressers) rather than a particular or unique item (e.g., Smith's last self-portrait, that guitar I saw here last week). Note that a Distributor may carry some particular goods, but may not have it on hand at that exact moment.  'Trader Joe's carries a wide variety of foods, drinks, and househole necessities.'","An event or state where a Distributor provides, offers, or makes available a type or class of Goods for distribution, sale, or lending, typically maintaining the capacity to supply those Goods.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,agentive
Bringing,Bringing,"[Bringing] This frame concerns the movement of a Theme and an Agent and/or Carrier.   The Agent, a person or other sentient entity, controls the shared Path by moving the Theme during the motion. In other words, the Agent has overall motion in directing the motion of the Theme.  The Carrier may be a separate entity, or it may be the Agent's body. The Constant_location may be a subregion of the Agent's body or (a subregion of) a vehicle that the Agent uses.  'Karl carried the books across campus to the library on his head.' 'Karl carried the books across campus to the library in his truck.' 'Karl carried the books across campus to the library by truck.' 'The truck carried the books across campus to the library in specially designed boxes.' The  FEs include Path, Goal, and Source.  Area is an area that contains the motion when the path is understood as irregular.   This frame emphasizes the path of movement as opposed to the FEs Source or Goal as in Filling or Placing. ","An event where an Agent or Carrier moves a Theme along a Path toward a Goal, controlling the movement during the process.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Building,Building,"[Building] This frame describes assembly or construction actions, where an Agent joins Components together to form a Created_entity, which is profiled, and hence the object of the verb.  'Jack built a new house out of bricks.' 'We glued the airplanes together.'",An event where an Agent assembles or constructs a new unified Entity by joining together multiple Components.,anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Cause change of position on a scale,Cause change of position on a scale,"[Cause_change_of_position_on_a_scale] This frame consists of words that indicate that an Agent or a Cause affects the position of an Item on some scale (the Attribute) to change it from an initial value (Value_1) to an end value (Value_2). The direction of the change (Path) can be encoded as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference). The rate of change of the value (Speed) can optionally be indicated as well as a second scale (Co_Variable), which the values are correlated with.  '' 'The company is raising the final dividend from 4.34p to 4.57p, to boost the total by 5.3 percent to 6.36p.'  'Similarly, a consumer boom will encourage the authorities to increase interest rates in order to keep money supply on target.'  'United Way of Central Indiana adds value to your investment.'","An event where an Agent or a Cause alters the position of an Item along a measurable scale, changing it from one value to another.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Cause change of strength,Cause change of strength,"[Cause_change_of_strength] An Agent causes a Patient to be more strong, often resulting in something that is more secure and safe.  'Local Serbs are strengthening their grip on a narrow corridor along the Sava River between two large Serbian areas.'","An event where an Agent causes a Patient to become stronger, more secure, or more resilient than before.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Employment,Being employed,"[Being employed] An Employee has a Position doing work in a particular Field, or doing work on a particular Task, for which an Employer gives Compensation to the Employee. Undocumented foreigners are working as building contractors for Laing Builders.",An event or state where an Employee holds a Position and performs work in exchange for Compensation provided by an Employer.,cumulative,homeomeric,durative,agentive
Change,"Cause change, Cause change of phase","[Cause_change] An Agent or Cause causes an Entity to change, either in its category membership or in terms of the value of an Attribute. In the former case, an Initial_category and a Final_category may be expressed, in the latter case an Initial_value and a Final_value can be specified.  'Our storylines follows the saga outlined by the Ultima Series, but we have modified it in order to make our writing more cohesive.'   'I don't think you can turn that rabbit into a hat.'  'How can a guy that changed his name from Bob Craft to Jack Ass declare anyone defamed his character?'  ' At this juncture, a new development changed the political situation on the island.'  'She had at some time earlier completely changed her clothing and appearance and now stood in front of me dressed like a garden gnome.'  'Hence, when (Hg 0 ) is converted to Hg 2+ , it can be rapidly taken up in rain water, snow, or adsorbed onto small particles' 'Hence, when (Hg 0 ) is converted to Hg 2+ , it can be rapidly taken up in rain water, snow, or adsorbed onto small particles'
[Cause_change_of_phase] A Cause or Agent causes a Patient to undergo a change of phase.  The Result of the change may be given, along with the Initial_state and the Circumstances under which the change can occur.  Note that this frame contrasts with Cause_change_of_consistency in that this frame describes causation of a change of a Patient between different phases (i.e. solid to liquid or frozen to ""unfrozen"").  ' Bob melted the butter. '   'Sally defrosted the chicken to eat for dinner. '  ","An event where an Agent or Cause induces a fundamental change in an Entity — either altering its attributes, category, or physical phase.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Expansion,Cause expansion,"[Cause_expansion] An  Agent or non-human Cause causes an Item to change its physical size.  The Size_change of an Item may be explicitly indicated or characterized in terms of Initial_size and/or Result_size.  In the default case, expansion is along all dimensions, but sometimes the Dimension of expansion is incorporated or made explicit.  'If the design crashes too often, then try lengthening the wings by a few centimeters, to perhaps 30cm total.  CNI INI '   'As the juice churned with natural process of changing into wine, the gas it created would expand the balloon, and when the balloon eventually deflated, it was ready to drink.'","An event where an Agent or non-human Cause induces a change in the physical size or dimensions of an Item, either overall or along specific directions.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Bodily harm,"Cause harm, Experience bodily harm","[Cause_harm] The words in this frame describe situations in which an Agent or a Cause injures a Victim. The Body_part of the Victim which is most directly affected may also be mentioned in the place of the Victim.  In such cases, the Victim is often indicated as a genitive modifier of the Body_part, in which case the Victim FE is indicated on a second FE layer. '' 'Rod saw his father beating his mother.'  'In the end Wormtongue is fed up with being beaten so he cuts Saruman's throat to free himself.'  'A mother stabbed to death by her husband made a secret will stating that he must never be allowed to care for their son.'
[Experience_bodily_harm] An Experiencer is involved in a bodily injury to a Body_part.  (In some cases, no Body_part need be indicated.)  Often an Injuring_entity on which the Experiencer injures themselves is mentioned. 'I think that I hurt myself pretty bad back there.' 'He smacked his head on the mantel getting up from poking at the fire.'","An event where a bodily injury occurs to a person, either caused intentionally or accidentally, affecting the whole person or a specific body part.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Cause to amalgamate,Cause to amalgamate,"[Cause_to_amalgamate] These words refer to an Agent joining Parts to form a Whole.  (The Parts may also be encoded as Part_1 and Part_2.)  There is a symmetrical relationship between the components that undergo the process, and afterwards the Parts are consumed and are no longer distinct entities that are easily discernable or separable in the Whole.  'Chuck merged the corpora.'' Chuck merged the corpora into a database.' 'Chuck merged the BNC with the AP Corpus into a database.' 'The two forces merged into a single, undifferentiated mass of murderous mayhem.(Sense 2)' 'Melt the butter, then blend it with the room temperature milk. CNI'  ","An event where an Agent causes multiple Parts to be combined into a single Whole, such that the original parts lose their distinct separateness in the resulting entity.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Cause to be included,Cause to be included,[Cause_to_be_included] An Agent or Cause makes a New_member part of  Group. The Group may be represented by an individual Existing_member if it implies the existence of a set of members.  'I added a new rock to my collection.' 'He decided he needed to add a red tie to the blue tie in his closet.',"An event where an Agent or Cause brings a New_member into an existing Group, making it part of that collective.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Change sentiment,Cause to experience,[Cause_to_experience] An Agent intentionally seeks to bring about an internal mental or emotional state in the Experiencer.  This frame in closely related to  Experiencer_obj.  ' Samantha terrorized the children into screaming. ',An event where an Agent intentionally causes an Experiencer to feel or undergo a specific internal mental or emotional state.,anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Cause to make progress,Cause to make progress,[Cause_to_make_progress] An Agent works on a Project so that it reaches a more advanced and desirable state.  'I improve FrameNet.',An event where an Agent acts to advance a Project or Entity toward a more developed or improved state.,cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Change of leadership,Change of leadership,"[Change_of_leadership] This frame concerns the appointment of a New_leader or removal from office of an Old_leader.  The Selector brings about the change in leadership, for example, by electing or overthrowing a leader. Some words in the frame describe the successful removal from office of a leader (e.g. depose, oust), .   'On March 17 , Mamedov appointed Rakhim Gasiyev as Defence Minister .'    ","An event where a Selector initiates the appointment of a New Leader or the removal of an Old Leader, resulting in a change in who holds a leadership position.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Change tool,Change tool,"[Change_tool] An Agent changes Tools, from the Old_tool to a New_tool.  The Tools may include vehicles, services providers, or more proto-typical implements.  'If this happens one more time, we 're going to switch operating systems.'  'Stephen had to transfer five times by the time he got to Lincolnville. DNI.'","An event where an Agent replaces one Tool, resource, or implement (the Old_tool) with a different one (the New_tool) for accomplishing a task or function.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Communication,"Chatting, Talking into, Communication response, Encoding, Contacting, Discussion, Successfully communicate message, Communication","[Chatting] A group of people (the Interlocutors or Interlocutor_1 and Interlocutor_2 together) have a conversation.  No person is construed as only a speaker or only an addressee. Rather, it is understood that both (or all) participants do some speaking and some listening--the process is understood to be symmetrical or reciprocal.  In this frame, the purpose of the conversation is generally social, rather than specifically to decide something or exchange information, or to quarrel (see Discussion and Quarreling).  'If you ain't got nothin' better to do, I 'd like to shoot the breeze with you for a couple.' 'We used to chat about everything.'
[Talking_into] A Speaker expresses through language his wish to get the Addressee to act.  The Addressee forms an intention to act and does so. '' 'You think I talked Peter into giving me those earrings, don't you?'  'Don't let a shop assistant talk you into buying a so-called ""orthopaedic"" bed -- there's no such thing.'
[Communication_response] This frame deals with a Speaker communicating a reply or response, a Message, to some prior communication or action, the Trigger.  '' 'The landlord has not yet replied in writing to the tenant objecting the proposed alterations.DNI'  '""No, I do not agree with you,"" responded another officer to the CEO. DNI'
[Encoding] A person (Speaker) expresses a Message or mental content, broadly understood, in a particular Manner. The content may be emotional, as in 'Humans express  feelings through words' intellectual, as in 'Formulate the idea carefully'  or linguistic, as in 'Phrase your question as a comment.'    
[Contacting] A Communicator (whose Location may be indicated) directs a Communication to an Addressee at a particular Address.  Note that no actual successful communicative act is implied, only the successful completion of acts which would establish the communication.  (In other words, Mari can e-mail Jon without Jon ever reading it.) NB:  The Address or Location_of_communicator may be a virtual address, such as an e-mail or telephone number.'Disgruntled voters phoned Congressman Neil at his Washington residence with complaints about the recent increases in corporate welfare.''She tried to call from the payphone down the street.' 
[Discussion] Two (or more) people (the Interlocutors, also encodable as Interlocutor_1 and Interlocutor_2) talk to one another. No person is construed as only a speaker or only an addressee. Rather, it is understood that both (or all) participants do some speaking and some listening--the process is understood to be symmetrical or reciprocal.  This frame differs from the Chatting frame in that the Interlocutors have a particular question that they are attempting to decide or understand.  'I would rather discuss politics with anyone but him.'   'World leaders met to discuss global warming on the coldest day of the year.'
[Successfully_communicate_message] A Communicator speaks to an Addressee in such a way that the Addressee understands and fully appreciates the truth and/or relevance of the Message.   ' Marred by overblown writing , this first novel by Wilbur Smith 's wife effectively conveys some of South Africa 's problems .INI'  'He conveys vividly the absurdity of a situation , but he is incurious about the underlying processes which shape it. INI'  'We've got to get the message through to them before they become sexually active.'  'Have you been using PowerPoint (PPT) for years and feel you don't always get your point across to the audience?'  'It 's impossible to convey how lost I felt. CNI  INI'  'But , alas , the printed word can not adequately convey the panting , gasping misery of this particular torment. INI'
[Communication] A Communicator conveys a Message to an Addressee; the Topic and Medium of the communication also may be expressed.  This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability. (MET)' 'It says a lot that he did n't come back.

Presence,"Circumscribed existence, Presence, Existence","[Circumscribed_existence] An Entity is understood to be experienceable within a particular set of delimited Circumstances, which may be more narrowly expressed by a Time, Place.  'This type of behavior occurs in several primate mating rituals.' 'Craft beers have started to appear in grocery stores all over the country.'
[Presence] An Entity exists at a particular Location, at a particular Time, as observed by an implicit observer. A Depictive and/or Duration phrase is often found.  This frame differs from Existence in that the Location is profiled as a ground where an observer is conceived of as confirming the Entity's existence.  'Liquid water was present on the surface of Mars billions of years ago.'  'Urate was present in varying concentrations in the bathing solution only.'  'No one was present. DNI'  'Your presence is appreciated. DNI'  In some cases, the Location may be recoverable from phrases that primarily express peripheral information:  'Was the senator present for the committee vote?' 'Was the senator present for the committee vote?'
[Existence] An Entity is declared to exist, generally irrespective of its position or even the possibility of its position being specified. Time, Duration, Inherent_purpose, and State may also be mentioned.  This frame is to be contrasted with Presence, which describes the existence of an Entity in a particular (and salient) spacio-temporal context, and which also entails the presence of an observer who can detect the existence of the Entity in that context.  'Finally, Poland ceased to exist as a state for hundreds of years.' 'Such laws exist to prevent exactly this kind of fraud.' 'There IS a Santa Claus!'","An event or state in which an Entity is understood to exist, either absolutely or within specific temporal, spatial, or situational boundaries, and may optionally be confirmed by an observer.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Collaboration,Collaboration,[Collaboration] Partner_1 and Partner_2 or a group of Partners  work together in some Undertaking.

Coming to believe,Coming to believe,"[Coming_to_believe] A person (the Cognizer) comes to believe something (the Content), sometimes after a process of reasoning. This change in belief is usually initiated by a person or piece of Evidence. Occasionally words in this domain are accompanied by phrases expressing Topic, i.e. that which the mental Content is about.

Commerce sell,Commerce sell,"[Commerce_sell] These are words describing basic commercial transactions involving a buyer and a seller exchanging money and goods, taking the perspective of the seller.  The words vary individually in the patterns of frame element realization they allow. For example, the typical patterns for SELL: SELLER sells GOODS to BUYER for MONEY.  'Robin sold a car to Abby for $5,000.'",An event where a Seller transfers Goods to a Buyer in exchange for Money.,anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Commitment,Commitment,[Commitment] A Speaker makes a commitment to an Addressee to carry out some future action.  This may be an action desirable (as with promise) or not desirable (as with threaten) to the Addressee. Some of the words in this frame allow an Addressee to be expressed. 'You promised me you'd come to my graduation.' Other words cannot normally occur with an Addressee. 'Kim undertook to finish the project by June.',"An event where a Speaker pledges or undertakes to perform a specific action in the future, directed toward or concerning an Addressee.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive

Competition,Competition,"[Competition] This frame is concerned with the idea that people (Participant_1, Participant_2, or Participants) participate in an organized, rule-governed activity (the Competition) in order to achieve some advantageous outcome (often the Prize).  Rank and Score are different criteria by which the degree of achievement of the advantageous outcome is judged.  'He and I played tennis.'

Giving,"Conferring benefit, Offering, Giving, Post giving","[Conferring_benefit] A Benefactor confers a Beneficial_situation to a Beneficiary.  Unlike in Commerce_scenario, the recipient is not necessarily required to pay for the good or service that they receive.  Therefore, the element of benevolence is profiled.  Dual FE-layer annotation:  'His presence at the summit did not BENEFIT diplomatic relations in the slightest.' 'His'  'The foundation's 50m donation BENEFITS the country's educational system immensely.' 'The foundation's'
[Offering] An Offerer indicates that he or she is able and willing to give a Theme to a Potential_recipient. In the absence of further qualifications, it is often understood that the Potential_recipient accepts the Theme.  'The host graciously offered us food and drink.'
[Giving] A Donor transfers a Theme from a Donor to a Recipient.  This frame includes only actions that are initiated by the Donor (the one that starts out owning the Theme).  Sentences (even metaphorical ones) must meet the following entailments: the  Donor first has possession of the Theme.  Following the transfer the Donor no longer has the Theme and the Recipient does. 'Barney gave the beer to Moe.' '$300 was endowed to the university to build a new performing arts building.'
[Post_giving] The stage immediately after the Donor gives the Recipient the Theme, i.e. when the Recipient has possession of the Theme and the Donor no longer does.

Confronting problem,"Confronting problem, Difficulty","[Confronting_problem] An Agent becomes involved in an Issue which has negative consequences for them. The Agent will normally respond to resolve the Issue.  'I confronted both issues.'
[Difficulty] An Experiencer has an easy or difficult time carrying out an Activity. The ease or difficulty associated with the Activity seems to often be associated with a prominent participant. However, we consider this impression to be due to the syntax and pragmatics of the relevant sentence constructions and employ no special FE for such participants. The Degree of ease or difficulty is often specified as well as a set of Circumstances. A Parameter may be mentioned that indicates in which respect the Activity is judged to be easy or difficult. '' Unmarked LUs of this frame indicate that something is easy, while LUs of this frame that mean the opposite of easy are marked with the semantic type ""Negative"", as in difficult.a, arduous.a, and a bitch.n.

Attack,"Counterattack, Attack, Invading, Suicide attack","[Counterattack] An Assailant physically attacks a Victim (which is usually but not always sentient), causing or intending to cause the Victim physical damage. The attack is a response to an earlier attack by the Victim on the current Assailant (or by actors associated with the Assailant or Victim).  A Weapon used by the Assailant may also be mentioned, in addition to the usual Place, Time, Purpose, Reason, etc.  Sometimes a location is used metonymically to stand for the Assailant or the Victim, and in such cases the Place FE will be annotated on a second FE layer.  'Are we counterattacking them just to keep them off balance?'
[Attack] An Assailant physically attacks a Victim (which is usually but not always sentient), causing or intending to cause the Victim physical damage.   A Weapon used by the Assailant may also be mentioned, in addition to the usual Place, Time, Purpose, Explanation, etc.  Sometimes a location is used metonymically to stand for the Assailant or the Victim, and in such cases the Place FE will be annotated on a second FE layer.

[Suicide_attack] An Assailant attacks a Victim, intending to die in the process. In the prototypical case, the attack is designed to kill the Assailant, as when a pilot deliberately crashes a plane into the target.  'The terrorist suicide attack on U.S. troops early last week caused more damage than initially reported.'  'They kamikazed the base in the middle of the night!'","An event where an Assailant intentionally initiates aggressive physical action against a Victim or Target, typically aiming to cause harm, damage, or domination, regardless of whether the Assailant survives the attack.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive

Inspecting, Scrutinizing for","[Court_examination] A Questioner asks a Witness (or defendant) questions in the context of a court procedure. 'We 'd like to cross-examine the witness if we can.'
[Scrutiny] This frame concerns a Cognizer (a person or other intelligent being) paying close attention to something, the Ground, in order to discover and note its salient characteristics.  The Cognizer may be interested in a particular characteristic or entity, the Phenomenon, that belongs to the Ground or is contained in the Ground (or to ensure that such a property of entity is not present).  Some words in this frame allow alternate expressions of the Groundand the Phenomenon: 'We searched the yard  for my contact lens.'
[Inspecting] An Inspector directs his/her perceptual attention to a Ground to ascertain whether the Ground is intact or  whether an Unwanted_entity is present. Alternatively, the desired outcome of the inspection may be presented as a Purpose.   'The police removed Flonnory and Barbour from the automobile and frisked them for weapons.'

Cure,Cure,"[Cure] This frame deals with a Healer treating and curing an Affliction (the injuries, disease, or pain) of the Patient, sometimes also mentioning the use of a particular Treatment or Medication. This frame differs from Medical_intervention in that this frame deals only with cases in which the Patient is cured of the Affliction, not just treated for the Affliction. '' 'Isis then cured Re by reciting a spell.'

Damaging,Damaging,"[Damaging] An Agent affects a Patient in such a way that the Patient (or some Subregion of the Patient) ends up in a non-canonical state.  Often, this non-canonical state is undesirable, and some lexical units (marked with the Negative semantic type) specifically indicate that the Patient is negatively affected.  Some lexical units of this frame indicate by what means the Patient is altered (e.g., scrape.v) and in some cases give some indication of the detailed effect on the Patient (e.g., score.v, chip.v), and in other cases, both are specified (tear.v). For another set of lexical units, the action and its result are much less specified (e.g., damage.v).  Compare this frame with Destroying, Cause_to_fragment, and Render_nonfunctional.  'That idiot just dented my car!' 'Some ne'er-do-wells defaced the Park's wall with spray paint to show their anger at local natural resources allocation policy.'

Deciding,"Deciding, Waver between options","[Deciding] A Cognizer makes a Decision, which may be about an entity or a course of action.  How (and whether) this frame is distinct from Choosing is currently up for debate.  'Mo decided to quit the program.' 
[Waver_between_options] A Cognizer faces a choice on some Issue. They have several Options  available but keep changing their mind between Option_1 and Option_2. The Cognizer may in fact act on their choice at some point but they need not; the Options can simply be considered for some time with one being favored for a while and then the other.  'Dave Hayes wavered about moving to California because so many of his friends are in Baltimore.'  'He had wavered between half a dozen places; it was pure chance that he had chosen Marvis Bay.'  'In any event, I still go back and forth on what I want to do. '  'He was firm in his beliefs, never waffled from one platform to another and was always harshly clear in his stance.'

Destroying,"Destroying, Cause to fragment, Render nonfunctional","[Destroying] A Destroyer (a conscious entity) or Cause (an event, or an entity involved in such an event) affects the Patient negatively so that the Patient no longer exists.  'An asteroid obliterated the dinosaurs.'
[Cause_to_fragment] An Agent suddenly and often violently separates the Whole_patient into two or more smaller Pieces, resulting in the Whole_patient no longer existing as such.  Several lexical items are marked with the semantic type Negative, which indicates that the fragmentation is necessarily judged as injurious to the original Whole_patient.  Compare this frame with Damaging, Render_non-functional, and Removing.  'He ripped up the letter faster than you can say ""Jack Robbins"". INI' 'Don't go in there or you 'll be torn to bits!

'Pakistanis in US trying to flee to Canada hit roadblocks.' 'Anderson's division suddenly bolted north from Devil's Den, flanked out III Corps almost entirely, and shattered the entire Corps.' 'We fled for several miles before reaching our safe-house.'
[Escaping] A Self-moving Escapee departs from an Undesirable_location.   'Benjamin escaped from Germany.'
[Evading] An Evader moves under its own power to thereby avoid Capture  or contact with a Pursuer, also generally moving under its own power. This frame characterizes a  more specific event  than Avoiding in that both the Evader and the Pursuer are moving entities.  In addition, this frame differs from Escaping by requiring a Pursuer and being neutral about the prior captivity of the Evader.  'I gave my handler the slip.'  'He evaded capture for several hours.'
[Quitting_a_place] A Self_mover leaves an initial Source location.  The Path by which the Self_mover departs, and the Intended_goal of the Direction may also be mentioned.  In many words which evoke this frame, there is an additional implication that the Self_mover is discontented with the Source location.  'I left San Francisco for Vancouver.'","An event where a living being or entity moves intentionally to avoid danger, threat, capture, or undesirable conditions, often by leaving, dodging, fleeing, or escaping from a source, pursuer, or harmful situation.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive

[Clothing] This frame refers to clothing and its characteristics,  including anything that people conventionally wear.  The Wearer wears a Garment that has a certain Style, is made of a certain Material, and can be otherwise characterized by a Descriptor.  In some cases, the Body_location (where the garment is worn) and Subregion of the clothing may also be specified.  'Claudia dressed in a dark green cotton DRESS clasped round her slender waist with a broad yellow belt , drank a cup of coffee and opened her neglected post .'
[Wearing] The words in this frame refer to what Clothing the Wearer (or a specific Body_part of the Wearer) has on.  'I had on the most ridiculous monkey-suit you could imagine.' 'These two losers were wearing bras on their heads!'  Many targets incorporate the Clothing item, and some targets describe the state of not wearing something (when it might be expected).  'Do you think anyone would notice if I went topless?'    NB: There is a very common metonymy in which characteristics of the clothing stand for the clothing itself, such as   'the man clad in leather.' 'She was dressed all in red.'  Such sentences should be tagged METAPHOR on the sentence level.","An event or state where a Wearer puts on, has on, or is characterized by wearing Clothing, which covers or adorns parts of their body.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Arriving,"Drop in on, Visitor arrival, Visit host arrival, Arriving, Visiting scenario arrival","[Drop_in_on] A Visitor arrives at the Host_location as a guest of the Host, for the purpose of achieving a Purpose.

Earnings and losses,Earnings and losses,"[Earnings_and_losses] An Earner receives Earnings by providing Goods to a Buyer; providing the Goods also generally entails a cost, which may or may not be included in the consideration.  This frame emphasizes the effect on the Earner and often generalizes across an indefinite number of transactions with various parties.  Some of the LUs (e.g. earn.v) primarily refer to the to the Earnings without reference to cost, others to the amount the Earnings differ from the cost, emphasizing either a net loss (e.g. loss.n) or net gain (e.g. net.n).

Emptying,"Emptying, Container focused removing","[Emptying] These are words relating to emptying containers and clearing areas of some substance or items. The area or container can appear as the direct object with all these verbs, and is designated  Source because it is the source of motion of the Theme. Corresponding to its nuclear argument status, it is also affected in some crucial way, unlike Source in other frames. Some words in this frame, such as empty, may also occur with Path or Goal expressions, e.g.  'The players emptied the bucket over his head. '

Action,"Enforcing, Execute plan, Conduct, Intentionally act","[Enforcing] An Agent acts to ensure that a Rule (often a constraint on behavior) is being followed. The Agent's action is according to a general plan for Rules (such that implicit in the Rule is the affordance to certain entities to ensure that the Rule is followed).

In some cases, the Agent is a focal participant in the Plan, although a separate Focal_participant may also be mentioned. The Plan may be specified for the Duration for which it is in effect.  'Health authorities say they have put measures into effect in all ports of entry and in centers of provinces.' 'Channing House has recently implemented a new dining program for residents on pureed diets.'  Note: the phrase <em>(put) in effect</em> is in the Being_in_effect frame.
[Conduct] An Agent acts in a certain Manner either generally or under some particular Circumstances. The conduct may also be directed specifically towards an Affected_party.  ' He pledges to  conduct himself  with honesty and humility.' ' This year they have behaved themselves particularly impudently.' ' His appearance was as   immaculate as ever and his bearing  composed and dignified. '
[Intentionally_act] This is an abstract frame for acts performed by sentient beings. It exists mostly for FE inheritance.  'I carried out the deed easily .'","An event where an Agent intentionally carries out actions according to a plan, rule, or behavioral standard to achieve or maintain a desired state or outcome.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Exchange,"Exchange, Exchange currency","[Exchange] Two parties, the Exchangers, each give and receive from the other Themes. The parties are also construable separately as Exchanger_1 and Exchanger_2,  in which case the Themes may be construed separately, too, as Theme_1 and Theme_2.   'They swapped the island with the Neapolitan government of the day for the much smaller Capri.' 'Then the teams swapped their draftees.' 'We exchanged addresses and he told us that next year when we are in Aruba we will visit with his family there. '   ''  Notice that this frame is to be differentiated from the Replacing frame, where there is no notion of trade between two parties and the focus is only on the relationship between two items that successively fulfill a function or participate in a relation. 
[Exchange_currency] A Money_owner exchanges Sum_1 in the  Source_currency for Sum_2 in the Target_currency at some Exchange_service.  'After checking into the Intourist-operated $30-a-day Hotel Zerafshon, we each exchanged $50 for Uzbek currency with a shifty loiterer in the lobby at the rate .'  'We recently exchanged $100 for Â£64.00 UK pounds.'  'If he exchanged the money into Deutsch-marks, his 18 marks in Germany can just barely obtain four Big Macs.'  'He said the most crucial evidence was that of former police reservist, Simo Petersen-Jessen, now in Australia, who had converted the money into rands.'  ","An event where two parties each give something and receive something from each other, resulting in a mutual transfer of items, goods, or information.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Expend resource,Expend resource,[Expend_resource] An Agent uses a Resource which is consumed and unavailable for future use.  'We exhausted our supply of oil long ago.',"An event where an Agent uses up a finite Resource, making it unavailable for further use.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Research,"Experimentation, Research","[Experimentation] An Experimenter conducts an Experiment based on a Hypothesis.  This Experiment contains a Control_group or Control_group_member which is compared with a Treatment_group or Treated_individual in order to determine the Result. '' 'Johann's experiment proved the new drug was effective in treating the disease.'  'Jacob placed the control group under a strong light for 20 hours each day.'   'Rolf tested his hypothesis in Vienna in 1973.'
[Research] A Researcher (an individual a group or institution) attempts to answer a Question by means of consulting literature,  observation, or conducting experiments in a particular Field pertinent to the Question. The Question may be underspecified in the form of a Topic.   ' Simmons and Nadel did research pertaining to Ardea purpurea and Egretta garzetta in 1998'","An agent systematically investigates a question or hypothesis by consulting evidence, making observations, or conducting experiments to discover or verify knowledge.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Extradition,Extradition,"[Extradition] A Suspect in a Current_jurisdiction is forced by Authorities (of the Current_jurisdiction) to go to the Crime_jurisdiction, i.e. the jurisdiction which requested that the Suspect be handed over for trial for a crime which he or she is suspected to have committed in the Crime_jurisdiction.  The purpose or reason for the extradition may also be expressed.  'The fraud was extradited from Venezuela to the US.' ",An event where Authorities transfer a Suspect from their current jurisdiction to another jurisdiction (the Crime_jurisdiction) to face legal proceedings for an alleged crime.,anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Filling,"Filling, Container focused placing","[Filling] These are words relating to filling containers and covering areas with some thing, things or substance, the Theme. The area or container can appear as the direct object with all these verbs, and is designated Goal because it is the goal of motion of the Theme. Corresponding to its nuclear argument status, it is also affected in some crucial way, unlike goals in other frames.  'Lionel Hutz coated the wall with paint. '
[Container_focused_placing] An Agent or Cause affects a Goal location by moving a Theme, but without necessarily filling or covering it.  This frame is for Inheritance purposes.","An event where an Agent or Cause moves a Theme into or onto a Goal (such as a container or area), typically to fill, cover, or affect the Goal's state through the placement of the Theme.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Rewards and punishments,"Fining, Execution,
Rewards and punishments, Corporal punishment","[Fining] The Payer is (legally) forced to pay a Fine by an official Speaker as a punishment for some action (the Reason).  The Speaker represents an entity which receives the payment. 'They were fined approximately $3.1 billion dollars for their knowing, malicious injury to consumers.' Compare to: Citing. 
[Execution] An Executioner punishes an individual (Executed) with death as a consequence of some action of the Evaluee (the Reason).  'The hooded man hanged the thief.'
[Rewards_and_punishments] An Agent (the punisher or rewarder) performs a Response_action on an Evaluee for a Reason, the Evaluee's actions or beliefs.   Means and Instrument may also be indicated. The goal of the punishment/reward is  to discourage/encourage the actions or beliefs.  Words in this frame presuppose that a judgment of the Evaluee has occurred and that the Evaluee is (or becomes) aware of the judgment.  This judgment was performed by a cognizer which is either the same as the Agent, or, minimally, a representative of the same institution.  'His punishment of the prisoners was too harsh.' 'Her punishment  was too harsh.' 'The penalty for this crime is death. ' 'I believe that this behaviour should be subject to disciplinary action.'
[Corporal_punishment] Blend of Rewards_and_punishments and Bodily_injury in which the Agent performs some action intended to cause Bodily harm to the Evaluee as a consequence of some action or belief of the Evaluee (the Reason).  'The Sheriff flogged him for his crimes.' ","An authority enforces a consequence on an individual as a response to their actions or beliefs, aiming to punish or regulate behavior.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Forming relationships,Forming relationships,[Forming_relationships] Partner_1 interacts with Partner_2 (also collectively expressible as Partners) to change their social relationship.    'I befriended the little pony by giving him a piece of apple.',An event where two entities interact in a way that establishes or modifies a social relationship between them.,anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Come together,"Gathering up, Come together","[Gathering_up] This frame describes an Agent's gathering of Individuals (people or entities) into a group, the  Aggregate, defined by relative proximity.  'The police gathered the suspects into a line-up.' Compare this frame with Congregating, and contrast it with Amalgamating.
[Come_together] In this frame a group of Individuals meet to form a Configuration. The Individuals or the Configuration may be expressed as the external argument of the predicates in this frame. In this frame, it is ambiguous whether or not the Individuals intentionally come together.  In an alternative construal, a grammatically more prominent Party_1 congregates with a Party_2, expressed as an oblique phrase. If this asymmetric construal is chosen, Purpose relates only to Party_1. '' The congregating happens in a certain Place and at a certain Time. '' 'The crowd came together in the courtyard.' 'The architects amassed in the lobby.' ","An event where individuals or entities are brought together by an Agent (gathering up) or come together on their own (congregating) to form a group or configuration, usually based on proximity.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Body movement,"Gesture, Body movement","[Gesture] The words in this frame have to do with non-verbal communication. Topic is not normally expressed with these words. This seems to be related to the absence of a verbal code in cases of gestural communication. Topic can be viewed as a partial characterization of a Message, but such partial characterization is either difficult or irrelevant in the absence of a verbal code.   'I gestured with my hand for him to come over.'
[Body_movement] This frame contains words for motions or actions an Agent performs using some part of his/her body.   A number of words in this frame occur as blends with Communication, in which the action has an Addressee.  For example,   'Pat nodded at Kim.'  These examples differ from Communication.Gesture in that no specific message need be expressed, as in  'She nodded to him to sit down.'  Since this frame involves a particular type of motion, it contains the frame elements Source, Path, Goal and Area, which originate in the motion frame.  All of these frame elements are generally expressed in PP Complements.  'The boy swung his legs from under the table.'","An event where an Agent uses body movements, either communicatively or non-communicatively, to perform an action or convey meaning, typically without the use of verbal language.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Getting,"Getting, Post getting","[Getting] A Recipient starts off without the Theme in their possession, and then comes to possess it.  Although the Source from which the Theme came is logically necessary, the Recipient and its changing relationship to the Theme is profiled.  'I got two whistles from John.'
[Post_getting] The stage after which the Recipient has acquired the Theme. ","An event where a Recipient, initially without a Theme, acquires possession of it, emphasizing the change in ownership or control over the Theme.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Having or lacking access,Having or lacking access,[Having_or_lacking_access] A Theme has access to a Useful_location or is blocked from it by a Barrier. '' 'Making services accessible to those with special needs is expensive.' 'I don't have access to the safe.' 'The regime has now restricted access to the internet. ',"A theme either has or is denied the ability to reach or use a valuable location, resource, or service.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Hiding objects,Hiding objects,"[Hiding_objects] An Agent causes a Hidden_object to become perceptually inaccessible to potential perceivers by placing it in a Hiding_place or putting in place an Obstruction that screens the object.  'Therefore, as I passed the school, I hid the gun and holster in the mailbox'  'Gruenwald hid the money at a local garbage dump then retrieved it the following morning.'  'In later books Harry often tries to hide his scar with his hair. '",An event where an Agent makes an Object perceptually inaccessible to others by placing it in a location or covering it with an Obstruction.,anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Hindering,Hindering,"[Hindering] In this frame a Hindrance makes it more difficult for a Protagonist to complete their intended Action or a Hindrance directly affects an Action where the Action can be a natural act or the actions of many individuals in a collective endeavor.  Crucially, these lexical units do not entail that the Protagonist was unable to complete the Action or that the Action did not occur. The Hindrance may indicate a lack of enablement or an obstacle on the natural progression of the Protagonist or Action   ' Malcolm was hindered by his drinking problem . '  ' A lack of money hampered our plans . ' ' Many candidates' progress is severely impeded because they have to resit for the exam. '  ' The new dam impeded the flow of water . '","An event where a Hindrance obstructs, delays, or makes it more difficult for a Protagonist or Action to proceed or be completed, without necessarily preventing it entirely.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Change event time,"Holding off on, Change event time, Change event duration","[Holding_off_on] An Agent decides temporarily not to perform a Desirable_action or not to interact with a Salient_entity.  'I have actually held off on buying some movies by WB because of those damned cases.'  'We held off on reporting this because, by all accounts, the young Oscar-nominee has NOT been offered the role.'  'This meant waiting with dinner until late. CNI'  'I waited with going to him and in retrospect think that that was a mistake.'
[Change_event_time] In this frame, an Agent or Cause changes the timing of an Event. The Event will then take place at the Destination_time or with respect to a Destination_event. This can be done with by certain Means, in a certain Manner or to a certain Degree.  'The rain delayed the baseball game.'
[Change_event_duration] In this frame, an Agent or Cause changes the duration of an Event. The Event will then take place for a New_duration, rather than the Initial_duration. This can be done with by certain Means, in a certain Manner or to a certain Degree.  'Don't let him prolong the discussion to an absurd length.'  'Harsh weather made it necessary to cut the tour short from its original four months to three. CNI'","An event where an Agent or Cause intentionally delays, reschedules, or alters the timing or duration of another Event, affecting when or how long it occurs.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Hostile encounter,Hostile encounter,"[Hostile_encounter] This frame consists of words that describe a hostile encounter between opposing forces (Side_1 and Side_2, collectively conceptualizable as Sides) over a disputed Issue and/or in order to reach a specific  Purpose. '' 'He still wants to fight Mike Tyson in about 8 months.'  'Dennis Andries's European cruiserweight title clash against Akim Tafer of France in Beausoleil last February has been voted as the EBU's fight of the year.'",An event where two opposing sides engage in a conflict or confrontation over a disputed issue or to achieve a specific purpose.,anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Imposing obligation,Imposing obligation,"[Imposing_obligation] A Duty is imposed on a Responsible_party according to a Principle which regulates how the Responsible_party should respond to a Situation.  The Situation may be expressed metonymically by reference to an Obligator, whose action invokes the Principle.  It is only rarely the case that the Principle and the Situation/Obligator are both expressed overtly.  'They escaped total Soviet invasion and occupation only by entering into a separate agreement that obligated them to military action against the retreating German armies.'  'The lease agreements bound them to make rent payments to Homeowners Rescue.'  'It was also discovered that with out her knowledge, he had committed her to a new TV series and he had already taken an advance on the money.'   'The Generality's invitation to give a conference on the theme obligated me to study GaudÃ­'s work even more.'","A situation where a duty or responsibility is placed on a party based on a principle, requiring them to act or respond in a particular way.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Ingestion,"Ingestion, Ingest substance","[Ingestion] An Ingestor consumes food or drink (Ingestibles), which entails putting the Ingestibles in the mouth for delivery to the digestive system.  This may include the use of an Instrument.  Sentences that describe the provision of food to others are NOT included in this frame.  'The wolves devoured the carcass completely.'
[Ingest_substance] In this frame an Ingestor takes a Substance into his or her body. The Delivery_device can appear as a direct object.    'You should refrain from taking vodka up the nose.'  'Smoking a cigarette only takes a couple of minutes . CNI '","An entity actively introduces a substance into their body, typically through physical intake mechanisms.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Institutionalization,Institutionalization,"[Institutionalization] A Patient is committed to the care of a medical Facility by a proper Authority. Regardless of whether the Patient agrees or does not agree with their placement in the Facility, the Authority judges that it is in the best interest of the Patient or his environment that the Patient receive treatment in the Facility.   'Ten years after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, a Chicago court declared his 56-year-old widow Mary insane and committed her to a mental institution.'  'A pregnant woman was hospitalized  with gunshots to her shoulder and abdomen. CNI INI'  'Arberg issued a two-sentence statement saying Rehnquist was hospitalized for a fever and undergoing tests.

Creating,"Intentionally create, Creating, Coming up with","[Intentionally_create] The Creator creates a new entity, the Created_entity, possibly out of Components.  'The Libyans were generating arms for export.'
[Creating] A Cause leads to the formation of a Created_entity.  'Dr. Frankenstein created a monster.'
[Coming_up_with] Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer creating a new intellectual entity, the Idea. These words are similar to words of physical creation such as build and make, and in some cases may be understood as metaphorically based on such words. However, the Ideas in this frame are predominantly conceptual in nature.  Compare this frame with Achieving_first.  In that frame, the fact that the idea is new to society is emphasized, whereas Coming_up_with refers to an agentive Cognizer using mental effort to figure something out, without any implication of the impact of the idea.  'I 've been trying to come up with a plan .'  ","An event where a Creator, through intentional action or causal processes, brings a new entity — physical, intellectual, or conceptual — into existence, possibly by assembling components or generating original ideas.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Judgment communication,"Judgment communication, Judgment direct address","[Judgment_communication] A Communicator communicates a judgment of an Evaluee to an Addressee.  The judgment may be positive (e.g. praise) or negative (e.g. criticize), and this is indicated by the semantic types Positive and Negative attached to the lexical units.  This frame does not contain words where Evaluee and the Addressee are necessarily the same .  'I commended his handling of the crisis.' 'Gaston denounced him to the committee.' This is distinct from the Judgment frame in that it involves the communication of an evaluation, rather than merely forming and holding a particular evaluation.
[Judgment_direct_address] In this frame, a Communicator judges the Addressee and then communicates that appraisal directly to the Addressee. The judgment is given for a particular Reason or about a particular Topic.  'The principal rebuked the student for cheating on the exam.'","An event where a Communicator expresses an evaluative judgment—positive or negative—about an entity (Evaluee or Addressee) to another party, making the assessment explicitly known.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Justifying,Justifying,"[Justifying] An Agent has done or omitted to do an Act or is responsible for the obtaining of a State_of_affairs, which a Judge deems to constitute a violation of an obligation or a moral guideline. The Agent gives a Reason why the Act or omission or State_of_affairs was licit despite appearances.  NOTE: There is a consistent metaphorical conception of justifying as defending.  Words in the defending frame can also be used in the justifying frame.  'Kim failed to fully justify his decision.'","An agent explains or defends an action, omission, or situation to show that it was acceptable despite appearing to violate a norm or obligation.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Kidnapping,Kidnapping,"[Kidnapping] The words in this frame describe situations in which a Perpetrator carries off and holds the Victim against his or her will by force.

Labeling,Labeling,"[Labeling] A Speaker uses as a Label to refer to an Entity. The Label is not a conventional name for the Entity but a description categorizing the Entity and thereby  expressing a judgment.  'Some labeled him a womanizer.'  'During her lifetime, her enemies branded her as a prostitute. '  ",An agent assigns a descriptive term to an entity in order to categorize it and express a judgment.,anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Legal rulings,Legal rulings,"[Legal_rulings] An Authority with the power to make decisions hands down a Finding over a question presented in a formal or informal Case.   'The judge ruled yesterday that the revisions were not adequate. DNI'  'A high court in London ruled on the case that a vulture fund can extract more than $20 million from Zambia for a debt.'

Lighting,Light movement,"[Light_movement] An Emitter emits a Beam of light from a Source, along a Path, and/or towards a Goal.  Essentially, this frame denotes the (semi-)fictive motion of the the Beam. 'Avoid allowing light to shine into neighbors' gardens.' 'Clear yellow sunlight shone through the window-panes.' 'She thinks the sun shines out of his backside.' '...when the candles shine out.' 'It shines in my eyes. ('It' is both Beam and Emitter, though only one will show up in the display.)

'The candlelight glinted from pearls and rubies.'",An event where an Emitter produces and projects a Beam of light from a Source along a Path toward a Goal.,cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Limiting,limiting/limitation,"[Limiting] An Agent or Cause limits a Range_of_options to having a certain Characteristic. The Characteristic may be that only certain types of the Range_of_options may be acceptable, or (in the case of a plural or mass Range_of_options) that only certain cardinalities or quanties are acceptable. Alternatively, the Degree to which the Range_of_options is limited may be mentioned.  'His choices in life have limited his opportunities severely.'  'Treatment was limited to one pill per day. CNI'
[Limitation] An Entity that would be expected to have a characteristic to a certain degree (typically based on comparison to other entities of the same type) instead has a more limited degree of that characteristic.  'The limitations on the theory's applicability made it unpopular in its time.'  'Are there any undocumented limitations on the use of this machine?'","An agent, cause, or condition restricts the range, quantity, or extent of something compared to what would typically be expected.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,non-agentive
Hold ,"Manipulation,  Manipulate into doing","[Manipulation] The words in this frame describe the manipulation of an Entity by an Agent.  Generally, this implies that the Entity is not deeply or permanently physically affected, nor is it overall moved from one place to another.  'Ian squeezed Mara's hand.' ''  A number of lexemes listed in this frame also occur in the Cause_motion frame (for example, push, yank).  Only the non-motion uses of these words belong in this frame, e.g., combinations such as push at, push on, yank at. 
[Manipulate_into_doing] A Manipulator gets his Victim to perform a Resulting_action against what their better judgment would have been at the time. The means by which the Manipulator overcomes or bypasses the Victim's resistance to act need not be linguistic expression.  In some cases, the Goods may stand in for a Resulting_action of the Victim giving the Manipulator the Goods. '' 'Are you trying to tell me that Ace blackmailed you into becoming his lover?'  'Stephanopoulos skillfully cajoles him into keeping quiet.'","An event where an Agent physically manipulates an Entity without fundamentally altering or relocating it, or mentally influences a Victim into performing an action they would otherwise resist.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,agentive
Manufacturing,Manufacturing,[Manufacturing] A Producer produces a Product from a Resource for commercial purposes. ' They produced only half of the units after an injunction to follow the environmental policy.',"An event where a Producer creates a Product from Resources, typically as part of a commercial or industrial process.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Military operation,Military operation,"[Military_operation] The Military of a Possessor (either a nation, institution, or private individual) conducts large-scale activities in a Area to accomplish military or combined military/non-military goals.  'These groups are known to have carried out attacks on international coalition forces operating in Afghanistan.'  'Anti-piracy operations will continue while new strategies are developed.'  This frame construes the operation asymmetrically: the Military acts with respect to military and political entities in the target Area. Compare this to (usually, but not always, lower-level and violent) military actions that can be understood symmetrically (war, battle, encounter, engagement, etc).","An organized set of large-scale activities carried out by a Military belonging to a Possessor (e.g., nation, institution) within a geographic Area, aimed at achieving military or combined military and non-military objectives.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Motion directional,"Motion directional, Intentional traversing, Traversing","[Motion_directional] In this frame a Theme moves in a certain Direction which is often determined by gravity or other natural, physical forces. The Theme is not necessarily a self-mover.  ' The paper fell to the floor.'  ' The girl dropped 13 stories to her death.'
[Intentional_traversing] A Self_mover intentionally moves in a Directionon a Path relative to landmark that is neither the Source nor the Goal of the overall motion. The shape or configuration of the Path may be expressed with a Path_shape   'Ambrose Powell forded over on one horse, and we drove the others after him.'  'We repassed the first day's battlefield and ascended the road to the city.'  'Jeff Manor and I climbed the North Face of Mt Shuksan, with cold, clear weather and solid ice.'
[Traversing] A Theme changes location with respect to a salient location, which can be expressed by a Source, Path, Goal, Area, Direction, Path_shape, or Distance, as shown in the examples below: ''  'Start your ascent from Achintree Farm in Glen Nevis.'  'We crossed the desert.'  'She jumped across the ditch that marked the entrance to the woods.'  'The children hopped into the neighbor's yard.'  'I leaped twenty feet before slipping and falling.'  'As they did so, the plane circled lower.'  'Boyner has been crisscrossing the country since May.'","An event where a Theme (an entity) changes its location relative to a landmark or moves along a path or direction, either intentionally (through self-movement) or due to external forces.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Motion,"Motion scenario, Temporary leave, Cause motion, Cause to move in place, Motion, Cause fluidic motion, Fluidic motion, Mass motion","[Motion_scenario] This frame binds together the various parts of movement, from setting out, to traveling, to arriving.
[Temporary_leave] A Person takes leave from his or her routine Activity (such as work or school) for a Duration of time.  The Duration can be any length of time, as long as the absence is temporary.     '' 'The claimant should then submit medical certificates for the duration of their absence from work.INI' '' 'He took three month's leave and went to our world assembly at Caux. DNI' '' 'Negroponte, who is on a two-year leave of absence from MIT, decided to stay on to the end of the present academic year.'
[Cause_motion] An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    'She threw her shoes into the dryer .' 'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .' 'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .' '' ''  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): 'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked ""Metaphor"", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. '' ''  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): ''  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. 'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.' ''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.' ''  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). 'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.' ''  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. 'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .' ''  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.  
[Cause_to_move_in_place] An Agent causes a Theme to move with respect to a certain Fixed_location, generally with a certain Periodicity, without undergoing unbounded translational motion or significant alteration of configuration/shape. 'Paul shook the remote control frantically.'
[Motion] Some entity (Theme) starts out in one place (Source) and ends up in some other place (Goal), having covered some space between the two (Path). Alternatively, the Area or Directionin which the Theme moves or the Distance of the movement may be mentioned.  'That kite you see just to the right of his head was moving around pretty fast but the camera seemed to catch it ok.'  'There are several accounts of the stench drifting to shore from the ships in the middle of the river'  'Dust particles floating about made him sneeze uncontrollably.'  'The grill, unsecured, rolled a few feet across the yard.'  'The swarm went away to the end of the hall.'  The frames that inherit the general Motion frame add some elaboration to this simple idea.  Inheriting frames can add Goal-profiling (arrive, reach), Source-profiling (leave, depart), or Path-profiling (traverse, cross), or aspects of the manner of motion (run, jog) or assumptions about the shape-properties, etc., of any of the places involved (insert, extract). A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'  This last type is annotated in the simple Motion frame.
[Cause_fluidic_motion] An Agent or a Cause causes a Fluid to move from a Source to a Goal along a Path or within an Area.  'I splattered red paint nearby.'
[Fluidic_motion] In this frame a Fluid moves from a Source to a Goal along a Path or within an Area.  ' The blood spurted from the wound. ''The water gushed into the house . '
[Mass_motion] A Mass_theme, generally made up of many individuals, moves from a Source to a Goal with some Path.   'Emails from so-called Nigerian princes flooded inboxes all over the US.'","An agent, cause, or entity initiates or undergoes movement from a source toward a goal along a path, optionally involving different manners, periodicities, or material forms.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Name conferral,Name conferral,[Name_conferral] This  frame contains words that talk about how Speakers name Entities.  'They drove through an area nicknamed Sniper's Alley' 'His parents named him Winston after the British prime minister.'   In this frame we will ignore uses of words like baptize and christen that don't clearly bring out the name conferral but talk about the meaning of baptism etc. as a sacrament:  'They christened  the child on December 4th.' 'Method was baptized into the church soon thereafter.' 'Cyril was baptized as  a Methodist.'  ,"An event where a Speaker assigns or confers a name onto an Entity, establishing or altering its designated label within a social or linguistic context.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive

Testing,"Operational testing, Examination","[Operational_testing] A Tester uses a concrete or conceptual Product in order to determine either whether it works or to find out how well or in which manner it works. The Tester may have particular Unwanted_characteristics in mind that they are specifically looking for. The operational test may also be carried out under a particular set of Circumstances that are typically relevant to the functioning of the Product.  'Sun has (hopefully) already tested it for compliance.' 'The Velcro hook and loop closure system has been tested under wet conditions and retains its holding power after 10,000 open and close functions. CNI INI' 'Roe revisited the compound and tested it as a mosquito repellent.'
[Examination] This frame deals with testing or examination of someone's Knowledge or skill in a particular area.  An Examiner conducts an Examination to an Examinee to determine the Examinee's Knowledge and/or determine their Qualification for some privilege; this proceeds either by the Examinee demonstrating a skill or by writing responses to questions. '' 'At the end of the trial period all three groups took an English for Commerce examination to assess progress.'  'Many constables had passed the Sergeant's exam.'

Participation,Participation,"[Participation] An Event with multiple Participants takes place. It can be presented either symmetrically with Participants or asymmetrically, giving Participant_1 greater prominence over Participant_2. If the Event is engaged in intentionally, then there is typically a shared Purpose between the Participants. It is, however, possible that an expressed Purpose only applies to Participant_1.   'MATAC looks forward to your participation in helping promote telework in the Mid-Atlantic region.'  ' FOAP provides participants with comprehensive clerical skills. DNI' ' FOAP provides participants with comprehensive clerical skills. '   'Our eight-year-old son was recently  peripherally involved in an incident which resulted in him being threatened with the strap.'

Patrolling,Patrolling,"[Patrolling] An individual or group, the Patrol moves through and examines a Ground in order to ensure that it is in a generally Desired_state_of_affairs, particularly that it is safe and contains no dangerous Unwanted_entity. Rather than moving through the Ground, the Patrol may simply move such that all the (relevant portions of) Ground can be observed and checked.  'Detective Jones patrolled the northern half of the building.'  'Security guards patrolled for intruders while the game was in progress.'",An event where an individual or group moves through or observes an area to monitor and ensure that it remains in a desired or safe state.,cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Perception active,Perception active,"[Perception_active] This frame contains perception words whose perceivers intentionally direct their attention to some entity or phenomenon in order to have a perceptual experience.  For this reason we call the perceiver role in this frame Perceiver_agentive.    'She gazed upon him fondly.'  Comparing the Perception_active frame to the Perception_experience frame, we note that for some modalities there are different lexical items in each frame.  For instance, whereas Perception_active contains the verb phrase look at, Perception_experience contains see.   For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical item in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell.  This first sentence exemplifies the Perception_active use of the verb smell:'Smell this to see if it's fresh.CNI' This second sentence exemplifies its Perception_experience sense: 'I smell something rotten.'

Placing,"Placing scenario, Placing, Being located","[Placing_scenario] This frame represents the abstract scene in which an Agent manipulates a Theme's location, thus affecting a Goal which ends up co-located with the Theme.  This frame is primarily for Inheritance.
[Placing] Generally without overall (translational) motion,  an Agent places a Theme at a location, the Goal, which is profiled.  In this frame, the Theme is under the control of the Agent/Cause at the time of its arrival at the Goal.  'David placed his briefcase on the floor.'  This frame differs from Filling in that it focuses on the Theme rather than the effect on the Goal entity.  It differs from Removing in focusing on the Goal rather than the Source of motion for the Theme.
","An agent deliberately positions a theme at a specified goal location, controlling the theme’s placement and emphasizing its final location.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Receiving ,"Post receiving, Receiving","
[Receiving] A Recipient comes into possession of the Theme as a result of the joint action of the Donor and the Recipient.  The Receiving frame like the Giving frame requires that the Donor first has possession of the Theme and that following the transfer, the Donorno longer has the Theme and the Recipient does.  'I recieved a box from him in the mail.'","An event or state where a Theme is transferred from a Donor to a Recipient, resulting in the Recipient coming into possession of the Theme.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive

Publishing,Publishing,"[Publishing] A Publisher makes a Work of an Author (or authors) available to some public Audience for general enjoyment, examination, and reference. The Medium of a Work can vary; examples include books, TV programs, movies, and radio shows. Publication normally involves a number of other events, such as editing and advertising of the Work, and mass production and sales of a represenation of the Work; thus in the most elaborated version of publication, there are a number of other potential roles, such as editor, publicist/advertizer, distributor, printer, etc., but none of these show up as separate, syntactically distinguished roles for the LUs in this frame.  'Doubleday is publishing my newest novel next week.'

Protest,Reasoning,"[Reasoning] An Arguer presents a Content, along with Support, to an Addressee.  The Content may refer elliptically to a course of action or it may refer to a proposition that the Addressee is to believe.

Reforming a system,Reforming a system,"[Reforming_a_system] Because it no longer functions adequately under the given circumstances, an Agent (or non-Agentive Cause) undertakes steps to change the structural makeup of a complex Entity with interdependent parts, for instance an institution or a system of laws. The Degree of change is typically gradual and partial rather than revolutionary and total. Note that with some LUs the Entity can be unexpressed when it is identical to the Agent.  'They want to reform the law on Sunday trading.' 'At the same time , the government reformed the rating system as it applied to companies.'  'This study investigates how and why the majority of large Slovak companies restructured without the help of foreign investors or a government.

Reveal secret,Reveal secret,"[Reveal_secret] A Speaker reveals Information that was previously secret to an Addressee. In some cases, the Addressee is expected to keep the Information from other parties. The Information may be damaging to the reputation of the Speaker. Instead of (or in addition to) a Speaker, a Medium may also be mentioned. Likewise, a Topic may be stated instead of Information. Some lexical units in this frame imply that the Addressee has already been confronted with the Information.

The Avenger inflicting thePunishment need not be the same as the Injured_Party who suffered the Injury,  but the Avenger does have to share the judgment that the Offender's action was wrong. The judgment that the Offender had inflicted an Injury  is made without regard to the law.  '(1) They took revenge for the deaths of two loyalist prisoners.' '(2) Lachlan went out to avenge them.'

Robbery ,Robbery,"[Robbery] These are words describing situations in which a Perpetrator wrongs a Victim by taking something (Goods) from them.  In some cases, the Source location from which the Goods were taken is used to metonymically refer to the Victim.  The robbery can be done in a particular Manner (for example, forcefully) and via a specific Means (for example, by threatening the Victim).  'Half of the team held up the tellers while the others were stationed to report the arrival of police.'  As opposed to Theft, Robbery focuses on the harm to the Victim and on the Source location from which the Goods have been removed, rather than the Goods themselves.","An event where a Perpetrator wrongs a Victim by forcefully or threateningly taking Goods from them, emphasizing harm to the Victim and the removal of Goods from a Source location.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Scouring,Scouring,"[Scouring] A Searcher looks all over a Ground in order to find a Sought_entity. The Sought_entity is not presupposed to exist. The search activity is not concerned with the state of the Ground, which is the case in the Inspecting frame, but only with the finding of the Sought_entity, which is desirable.   'The newcomers combed the area looking for minerals' 'Scientists scoured the ice samples  for signs of life.

Self motion,Self motion,"[Self_motion] The Self_mover, a living being, moves under its own direction along a Path. Alternatively or in addition to Path, an Area, Direction, Source, or Goal for the movement may be mentioned.   'She walked along the road for a while.'  Many of the lexical units in this frame can also describe the motion of vehicles (e.g., as external arguments). We treat these as belonging in this frame.   'The cars scooted slowly towards the intersection.'  Self_motion most prototypically involves individuals moving under their own power by means of their bodies. Many words also specify the manner of motion (swim, walk). This frame contains mostly words that fit this prototypical scenario, but the frame itself does not specify whether a separate vehicle is impossible, necessary, or unspecified. Lexical units that involve separate vehicles are associated with FEs that are not appropriate for the more general case of motion, so they are placed in the Operate_vehicle or Ride_vehicle frames (e.g., He drove across the country, She flew to Europe).","An event where a living being or entity initiates and controls its own movement along a path, toward a goal, or within an area, using its own means of locomotion.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Sending,"Sending, Delivery, Product delivery, Transfer","[Sending] A Sender plans the Path (along with Source and Goal) of a Theme and places it in circumstances such that it travels along this Path under the power of some entity other than the Sender.  This frame also has a Recipient distinct from the Goal, as both can be present: 'I sent the manuscript to England to Bill.' 'I forwarded the grain to a dealer in Frankfurt.'  This frame contains verbs that participate in the ditransitive construction, with a recipient as the direct object, as in the following: 'I sent Bill the manuscript.' Certain Verbs in this Frame focus on the initial sending act, while others do not.  For example, I sent it rapidly can either mean the act of sending was initiated quickly or that it moved quickly. However, the in following sentence: I exported/dispatched it rapidly, meaning that the act was begun quickly, both types of verbs are included.
[Delivery] A Deliverer hands off a Theme to a Recipient or (more indirectly) a Goal location, which is accessible to the Recipient.    'The staff of Ebags delivered the umbrella well ahead of schedule.'  'In each class a dove flew in and delivered a red rose to Ginny.'  'The Pontifical Delegation for the delivery of the Icon of the Kazan Mother of God will arrive tomorrow. '
[Product_delivery] In order to facilitate the purchase of Goods which start off in a location distant from a Purchaser, a Deliverer transports and hands off the Goods to a Purchaser or (more indirectly) a Goal location which is accessible to the Purchaser.

[Commerce_buy] These are words describing a basic commercial transaction involving a Buyer and a Seller exchanging Money and Goods, taking the perspective of the Buyer.

Social event,"Social event individuals, Social event collective, Social event","[Social_event_individuals] This frames describes a social event where there may or may not be a permanent or semi-permanent relationship between participants. Additionally, participants in this frame are expressed separately, as Party_1 and Party_2.  Note the difference between this frame and Social_event_collective, where participants are grouped into one collective grammatical constituent and FE.  'I went out with him on Friday.'
[Social_event_collective] This frames describes a social event where there may or may not be a permanent or semi-permanent relationship between participants. Additionally, participants in this frame are expressed in one representative FE, Attendees.  Note the difference between this frame and Social_event_individuals, where participants are grammatically separated.  'Our date yesterday was interrupted by my ex-boyfriend!'
[Social_event] A Social_event occurs at which Attendees are present to conduct a social function or joint activity.  The Social_event is often a party or celebration, in which case it is possible to express someone who is being honored (the Honoree) or its function may be to celebrate an Occasion at which Attendees are present. Often, a specific Attendee, the Host, provides a venue for people to gather.  'Sue threw a party for Bob's birthday.'

Connect,"Spatial contact, Attaching","[Spatial_contact] A Figure is located in contact with a Ground.  With some words that evoke this frame, the Figure is also asserted to be fully or partially supported by the Ground (e.g. on), while in others a support relation is either denied (e.g. to, as in ""she put her hand to the wall"") or unspecified (e.g. against).  In addition, some LUs assert a direction in which to find the Figure from the Ground (e.g. atop).  'There was a tight-fitting lid on the bottle .' 'Against the back wall stood a young black man staring at his shoes .' 'Against the back wall three students were reading .' 'Clean if the jewelery is ever in contact with water or chlorine .'  This frame participates in productive metaphor cases, like ""shining a light on corruption"", ""Stalin's hand lay heavy on the presses"", ""it touched her heart"" in each of which an abstract entity affects another entity as if they were in physical contact. ''  This frame is intended to cover the description of writing, images, or situations being depicted on a document, canvas, screen, or other flat surface, including metaphorical cases where there is no literal document, like ""on record"" or ""pretty low on my list"". 'They were arguing on screen .' 'Watching chess is pretty low on my list .'  The use of on.prep to describe use of a vehicle is not included in this frame even though it does involve contact and support. The sense distinction is proven by the omissability of the Ground only in the vehicle cases: 'She is already on (the bus/the ship...) .' 'My paper is on *(the desk) .' This use is related to Ride_vehicle.  A similar argument holds for uses of on.prep with a clothing Figure, which virtually always omits the Ground; see Wearing. ''  The use of on.prep and upon.prep for Topics is considered a non-productive metaphor (see Topic).  No other target in the frame allows the use, nor is is correlated with other language of the source domain of contact (e.g. stand, sit, lie, put, rest). 
[Attaching] The Attaching frame covers two situations: a scene in which somebody causes one thing to be physically connected to something else; or a scene in which somebody causes two things to be connected to each other.  In the first, the frame includes an Agent who attaches an Item to a Goal by manipulating a Connector, creating an asymmetric relationship between the Item and the Goal.  In the second, the Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each serves as a Goal for the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items. In both cases, the  Connector remains to bind the two entities (either Item and Goal, or two Items), without creating a new entity.  'The robber tied Harry to the chair.'  'Make sure you bind his wrists as tightly as possible.'","An event or state where a Figure entity is in physical or metaphorical contact with a Ground entity, with or without support, and possibly involving attachment through a connector or maintained positioning.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive
Expressing publicly ,"Speak on topic, Expressing publicly","[Speak_on_topic] A Speaker addresses an Audience on a particular Topic.  The Audience is generally passive, although for many types of address (including academic talks and press conferences), a discussion or question-answer period is virtually always required.  'McNamara addressed congress on the state of affairs of the Department of Defense.'
[Expressing_publicly] A Communicator publically communicates some difficult-to-express Content which they (or a social group of which they are a member) have had for some time. The Content may not have been previously communicated due to inability or social stricture.  In cases where the individuals addressed are a smaller group than the public at large, a separate Addressee may be expressed.  'Those grievances can be aired during Board meetings. CNI'  'Saddam voiced his joy when he was told Spain's new government had left the US-led military coalition in Iraq.'   ","An event where a Speaker or Communicator addresses an Audience by sharing a Topic or previously unexpressed Content, typically in a formal or public setting.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Statement,"Statement, Claim ownership","[Statement] This frame contains verbs and nouns that communicate the act of a Speaker to address a Message to some Addressee using language. Instead of (or in addition to) a Speaker, a Medium may also be mentioned. Likewise, a Topic may be stated instead of a Message. A number of the words can be used performatively, such as declare and insist.  'I now declare you members of this Society.'   'She said that I would be late .'  'The announcement about raffle winners came across the loudspeaker.' 
[Claim_ownership] A Claimant asserts his or her right to possession of a piece of Property (either real, such as land, or private).  The Claimant may be acting on the behalf of a Beneficiary. 'The King claims this land and surrounding waters.' 'Hoping to strike it rich, Thaddeus Gulch staked his claim by the river bed.' 'I <supp>have</supp> dibs on the last piece of cake.'","An event where a Speaker communicates information or asserts ownership over something, typically using language or symbolic acts directed toward an audience.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Convincing,"Suasion, Attempt suasion","[Suasion] A Speaker succeeds in getting an Addressee to believe or plan to execute the Content the Speaker has in mind. In most cases, the information is related to some course of action for the Addressee, and the words of this frame imply that the Addressee has formed an intention to act consistently with the Content. There is no implication that the Addressee actually acts upon the intention formed. In the case of convince and persuade, the act that the Speaker wishes the Addressee to perform can be the adoption of a belief, which may be expressed as a that-clause or as an of-PP complement.  This frame differs from Attempt_suasion in that in Suasion, the Addressee has changed their mind in accord with the Speaker's wishes, whereas in Attempt_suasion, the only implication is that the Speaker communicates with the intent of changing the mind of the Addressee.   This Frame has unique Frame-to-Frame Relations: it inherits from and uses the Eventive_cognizer_affecting frame. This is atypical of FrameNet's frame relations.  '' 'At one point, Walter tries to convince his wife that he has had a story accepted by BBC Radio.'  'They invaded the bridge, but were dissuaded from further action by the captain.'
[Attempt_suasion] The  Speaker expresses through language his wish to get the Addressee to act in some way that will help to bring about events or states described in the Content. There is no implication that the Addressee forms an intention to act, let alone acts.     'Mr Smithers always encourages the employees to stay late and work harder.'  'Dennis Rodman advises moderation in all things. INI'  The Content most prototypically refers to an action that the Addressee will carry out themselves, but may (in the case of valences with a non-finite Content clause) merely refer to a situation that they have indirect influence over, as in the following  'When I talked to her, I suggested that he be removed from office . DNI '","An event where a Speaker attempts to influence an Addressee to adopt a belief, form an intention, or agree to a course of action, whether or not the Addressee ultimately acts on it.",anti-cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Submitting documents,Submitting documents,"[Submitting_documents] A Submittor gives Documents to an Authority so that they can be processed as part of an application, evaluation or other official or bureaucratic process.   'I  was sure I had passed as soon as I handed in the test. DNI'  'She stated that she turned in the paperwork yesterday.'  'After the applicant's submission to the department, the department chairperson must evaluate.'  'I acknowledge my submission of the Material to you shall not lead to a concurrent review by any of your affiliate and subsidiary channels.'","An individual provides documents to an authority for official evaluation, processing, or consideration.",anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Supply,Supply,"[Supply] A Supplier gives a Theme to a Recipient to fulfill a need or purpose (Imposed_purpose) of the Recipient.   'Habituating the ground nesting chimp groups is done by provisioning them with sugar cane. CNI INI'  'I have equipped my leech troopers with tiny subspace displacement thingummies. INI'   ' She sat down on her bed, carefully folding her clothing and packing it into the small carryall Starfleet had provided her for the journey.'",An event where a Supplier provides something (a Theme) to a Recipient to meet a specific need or serve a particular purpose.,cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Supporting,Supporting,[Supporting] A Supporter assists to strengthen the Supported by lending itself in material aid (or abstract assistance in the case of metaphorical uses).   'The bottom of the wall is supported by the foundation.'  'Many legislators have supported the industry in the past.'  'The revetment layers buttressed the mud-mortared cobblestone core wall.'  'Online gambling can bolster the US economy.',"An event where a Supporter provides material or abstract aid to reinforce, uphold, or strengthen the Supported entity.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Surrendering,"Surrendering, Surrendering possession","[Surrendering] In this frame a Fugitive presents himself or herself to the Authorities to be subject to the criminal process. ' The bank robber surrendered to Berkeley police. ' ' Norte is expected to surrender to police tomorrow on tax fraud charges . '
[Surrendering_possession] A Surrenderer is compelled to transfer a Theme to a Recipient.  'Shortly after the boy surrendered the gun, the three remaining warriors made a rush for liberty.'  'He finally surrendered the item after cops and Secret Service agents showed up at his home Saturday.'  'D?Augustino yielded the weapon to Herrick.'",An event where an individual or entity willingly or under compulsion relinquishes themselves or a possession to an authority or recipient.,anti-cumulative,homeomeric,atomic,agentive
Surrounding,Surrounding,"[Surrounding] A Figure surrounds a Ground.  The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .' 'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure ""covering"" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). '' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically ""impinging"" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: 'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008' 'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefieldâ€” mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. ' 'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions ('the hopelessness surrounding them'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies ('Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.","An event or state where a Figure partially or completely encompasses, covers, or encircles a Ground, either physically or metaphorically, influencing its spatial or conceptual context.",cumulative,homeomeric,durative,non-agentive

Writing,Text creation,"[Text_creation] An Author creates a Text, either written, such as a letter, or spoken, such as a speech,  that contains meaningful linguistic tokens, and may have a particular Addressee in mind.

'Jot any notes you need below the line in red pen only.'","An event where an Author produces a Text, either written or spoken, consisting of meaningful linguistic content, often directed toward an Addressee.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
Theft,Theft,[Theft] These are words describing situations in which a Perpetrator takes Goods from a  Victim or a Source. The Means by which this is accomplished may also be expressed.

'Samantha journeyed 2500 miles with her family by sea to China.''The Osbournes took a trip from Beverly Hills to London on the Concorde.'","An event where an Agent moves to and/or experiences a location, typically to fulfill a purpose such as exploration, learning, inspection, or social engagement.",cumulative,anti-homeomeric,durative,agentive
